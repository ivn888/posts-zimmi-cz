	<p>GDAL with its ogr2ogr, ogrinfo and many more is one of the best open source tools to do anything to your spatial data. It is a&nbsp;command line tool, which sort of determines it to be used with UNIX systems, but you might bump into a Windows guy trying to use it as well once in a while.</p>

<p>Be careful, it behaves differently on different OS. Let&#8217;s say you do something like this on UNIX:</p>

<pre><code>ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON -where "attribute IN ('value1', 'value2')" output.json input.json
</code></pre>

<p>What you <abbr title="But you might get expected result as well">might get is a big nothing</abbr>. Executed on Windows it gives you the result you&#8217;ve expected. <em>Aargh</em>, what is that supposed to mean?</p>

<p>Well, that&#8217;s the ogr2ogr&#8217;s way to tell you: <em>Hello there, you need to switch single quotes for double quotes and vice versa, you dumb!</em> I don&#8217;t know why and I find it really annoying. Just in case you get stuck with ogr2ogr (or probably any other command line tool), try this.</p>

	<p>I found an <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25952380/php-find-a-maximum-average-for-10-subsequent-numbers-in-a-list-of-50-random-numb">interesting question</a> at StackOverflow asking for help finding solution to what I have already mentioned in the title, with PHP. I gave it a try before reading answers and came up with the following code:</p>

<pre><code>$avg  = // value we are looking for
$size = count($numbers);

for ($i = 0; $i &lt; $size; $i += 1) {
    if ($i + 9 &lt; 51) {
        $val += $numbers[$i];
        for ($j = $i + 1; $j &lt; 10 + $i; $j += 1) {
            $val += $numbers[$j];
        }
        if ($val / 10 &gt;= $avg) { // hit
            // do something
        }
        $val = 0;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>That was the first that I could think of. And it worked. The answer given by Dave Chen was much more elegant than my solution (although I think it does something a bit different, but that&#8217;s not the point here):</p>

<pre><code>$number = 10; //numbers in a set
$max = 0;
$index = 0;

$size = sizeof($numbers) - $number;
for ($i = 0; $i &lt; $size; $i++) {
    $tmp = array_sum(array_slice($numbers, $i, $number)) / $number;
    if ($tmp &gt; $max) {
        $max = $tmp;
        $index = $i;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I made a simple benchmark with <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.microtime.php"><code>microtime()</code></a> and found out that my solution (ran 100k times) took about ~12.3 seconds while Dave&#8217;s took only ~7.4 seconds to finish. That makes his code almost twice faster than mine.</p>

	<p>PostgreSQL is set to listen only to connections coming from localhost by default. I guess that&#8217;s fine as far as you don&#8217;t need access to the database from anywhere else (like your work network). If you do, you need to log via SSH or use some online database management tool (go for <a href="http://adminer.org">Adminer</a> and forget about anything called php[pg|my]admin). Or you can set it up to access connections from other locations.</p>

<p>You need to:</p>

<ol>
<li>set <code>listen_addresses</code> to <code>*</code> in your postgres.conf. That does not mean anyone can connect to your database, that means that the server will listen to connections coming from any available IP interface.</li>
<li>insert new entry into pg_hba.conf looking like this: <code>host database user xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx md5</code>. Now we&#8217;re saying we only want connections coming from IP <code>xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx</code> accepted.</li>
<li><p>Add rule allowing the database server access to iptables. Number 5 says it will be the fifth rule in the order. It must come before the final REJECT ALL rule if present.</p>

<p><code>iptables -I INPUT 5 -p tcp --dport 5432 -s xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -j ACCEPT</code></p></li>
<li><p>Just to be sure noone else is able to connect, reject all on port 5432.</p>

<p><code>iptables -I INPUT 6 -p tcp --dport 5432 -j REJECT</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>You&#8217;re set to remotely connect to your database server.</p>

	<p>It happens that you receive a file with longitude and latitude just in the opposite order that you would like to have. It&#8217;s fairly easy to switch those without loading it into Excel or Calc and doing <code>Ctrl + C</code> and <code>Ctrl + V</code> on columns.</p>

<p>If you have a file with tabular data that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code> 50.52, 60.15
 70.96, 80.1
-55.23, 62.03

<p>You can use Sublime Text to switch the values:</p>

	</header>
	<section>
	<p>I was made to use ArcGIS Server with <a href="http://openlayers.org">Openlayers 3</a> just recently as one of the projects I&#8217;ve been working on demands such different tools to work together. </p>

<p><strong>tl;dr: I hate Esri.</strong></p>

<p>I found myself in need to access secured layers published via WMS on ArcGIS Server using username and password I was given, so here&#8217;s a little how-to for anyone who would have to do the same.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s start with a simple ol.layer.Image and pretend this is the secured layer we&#8217;re looking for:</p>

<pre><code>var layer = new ol.layer.Image({
    extent: extent,
    source: new ol.source.ImageWMS(/** @type {olx.source.ImageWMSOptions} */ ({
        url: url,
        params: {
            'LAYERS': 'layer',
            'CRS': 'EPSG:3857',
        }
    }))
});
</code></pre>

<p>We need to retrieve the token, so we define a function:</p>

<pre><code>function retrieveToken(callback) {
    var req = new XMLHttpRequest;

    req.onload = function() {
        if (req.status == "200") {
            var response = JSON.parse(req.responseText);
            if (response.contents) {
                callback(response.contents); // response contents is where the token is stored
        }
    };
    req.open("get", "http://server.address/arcgis/tokens/?request=getToken&amp;username=username&amp;password=password&amp;expiration=60", true);
    req.send()
}
</code></pre>

<p>I pass a parameter called <code>callback</code> - that&#8217;s a very important step, otherwise you would not be able to retrieve the token when you actually need it (AJAX stands for asynchronous). Now you just pass the token to the layer params like this:</p>

<pre><code>retrieveToken(function(token) {
    layer.getSource().updateParams({
        token: token
    })
}
</code></pre>

<p>When you open Firebug and inspect Network tab, you should find <code>token</code> URL parameter passed along with WMS <code>GetMap</code> request.</p>

<p>Few sidenotes:</p>

<ol>
<li>Although you might be logged in ArcGIS Server via web interface, you might need to pass the <code>token</code>  URL param when trying to access Capabilities document. Don&#8217;t know why though.</li>
<li>You should probably take care of calling the <code>retrieveToken()</code> in shorter interval than the token expiration is set to. Otherwise you might end up with invalid token.</li>
<li>You need to hide the username and password from anonymous users (I guess that&#8217;s only possible with server side implementation of selective JavaScript loading).</li>
</ol>

	<p>I love blogging. I hate blogging systems. I hate content management systems. I just want to blog. That&#8217;s what <a href="http://bolt80.com/piecrust/">PieCrust</a> is all about - it lets you blog.</p>

<p>It is powerful static website generator perfect for my needs (and for yours as well?). Blogging with PieCrust is really a piece of cake:</p>

<ol>
<li>prepare post</li>
<li>serve site</li>
<li>bake site</li>
<li>send it off to the public</li>
</ol>

<p>I love having clean OS. That&#8217;s what <a href="http://docker.com">Docker</a> is all about - for me. Running PieCrust on Docker is really easy, it does not clutter your PC and it just works.</p>

<p>If you ever want to use PieCrust on Docker, why don&#8217;t you start with this code?
    FROM centos:centos6</p>

<pre><code>RUN rpm -Uvh http://mirror.webtatic.com/yum/el6/latest.rpm
RUN rpm -Uvh http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
RUN rpm -Uvh http://rpms.famillecollet.com/enterprise/remi-release-6.rpm

RUN yum --enablerepo=remi,remi-php55 install -y php php-mbstring php-opcache php-cli php-pear php-common &amp;&amp; yum clean all
RUN php -r "readfile('https://getcomposer.org/installer');" | php
RUN echo "date.timezone = Europe/Prague" &gt;&gt; /etc/php.ini
RUN mv composer.phar /usr/bin/composer
RUN php -r "eval('?&gt;'.file_get_contents('http://backend.bolt80.com/piecrust/install'));"
RUN mv piecrust.phar /usr/bin/chef

CMD ["/bin/bash"]
</code></pre>

<p>Running <code>sudo docker build --tag=piecrust .</code> will result in having docker container ready to run. Just run <code>sudo docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -v /host_piecrust_path/:/container_path piecrust /bin/bash</code> in terminal. While in container terminal, run <code>chef serve -n -p 8080 -a 0.0.0.0</code> and visit <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a>. You should see your PieCrust site up and running.</p>

<p>The last command tells chef to serve your site on port 8080 (which should be free unless you&#8217;re running Tomcat or something like that) and make it listen on every available network interface. If you used 127.0.0.1 instead, you would never reach your site from outside the container.</p>

<p>See? Easy.</p>

	<section>
	<p>I have found a nice way to get decimal value from degrees of longitude and latitude recently:</p>

<pre><code>function format(coords) {
    var decimal = 0,
        output  = [],
        coords  = coords.split('  '); // it might be &lt;br&gt; as well

    for (var i = 0; i &lt; coords.length; i += 1) {
        var c = coords[i].split(' ');

        for (var j = 0; j &lt; c.length; j += 1) {
            decimal += c[j].slice(0, -1) / Math.pow(60, j);
        }

        output.push(parseFloat(decimal).toFixed(5));
        decimal = 0;
    }

    prompt('Souřadnice bodu', output.join(', '));
}
</code></pre>

<p>When you call <code>format("DD° MM' SS'  DD° MM' SS'");</code> you&#8217;ll get decimal value in return (or <code>prompt</code> to be accurate). What I like the most about this solution is the usage of Math.pow(). I think it is a neat way to transform the values as you need to divide parts of latitude or longitude by 60<sup>0</sup>, 60<sup>1</sup> and 60<sup>2</sup> respectively.</p>

<p>There is definitely a googol of different solutions to this task, I just liked the simplicity of this one.</p>

	<section>
	<p>Printing a web map requires a lot more than doing <code>Ctrl + P</code>. <a href="http://mapfish.org/">MapFish</a> seems to be the best option to use with Geoserver, and it comes <a href="http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/community/printing/">ready as an extension</a>. If you installed the module properly, you should be seeing general info at <a href="http://localhost:8080/geoserver/pdf/info.json">http://localhost:8080/geoserver/pdf/info.json</a>. You&#8217;ll find a <code>config.yaml</code> in <code>data_dir/printing</code>.</p>

<p>MapFish lets you access three different points:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>info.json</code> that returns current config as defined in config.yaml file</li>
<li><code>print.pdf</code> that actually prints the map as defined in the <code>spec</code> GET argument</li>
<li><code>create.json</code> that returns a JSON object with an URL of the printed map</li>
</ol>

<p>Remember, if you&#8217;re displaying a lot of layers in the map and all of them should be printed, you need to pass it as a POST argument when calling <code>print.pdf</code> or <code>create.json</code>, otherwise you&#8217;ll be getting an error complaining about the GET request length.</p>

<p>The <code>config.yaml</code> file is where you define settings for the print module. You definitely want to define <code>dpis</code> (we&#8217;re using 90, 200 and 300 DPI), <code>scales</code> (they probably need to be hardcoded, I didn&#8217;t succeed trying any arbitrary scale) and <code>layouts</code> (we&#8217;re using A4 to A0 both portrait and landscape).</p>

<p>However, defining the page size might get tricky as MapFish does not use standardized sizes defined in cm, in or any other unit. I&#8217;ve experimenting and doing some maths and here&#8217;s what I came up with for portrait layouts.</p>

<table class="table-centered">
    <tr>
        <th>A0</th>
        <th>A1</th>
        <th>A2</th>
        <th>A3</th>
        <th>A4</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2382&times;3361</td>
        <td>1683&times;2380</td>
        <td>1190&times;1680</td>
        <td>840&times;1180</td>
        <td>595&times;832</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p><em>The bigger paper you use, the smaller DPI is available</em>, that&#8217;s what I found out messing around with MapFish settings. This means that we&#8217;re using 200 DPI top for A2 layout and 90 DPI for A1 and A0 layout, respectively.</p>

<p>JQuery takes care of sending POST request and fetching the response. <a href="http://www.edpp.cz/poli_mapa-povodnoveho-planu-mesta/">See it in action</a> (Choose <em>Nástroje</em> and <em>Tisknout</em> for printing).</p>

	<p>I am writing a diploma thesis focused on extracting spatial data from social networks. I have been working mainly with Twitter API and results I have got so far look really promising. This post was written as a reaction to many retweets I got when I shared one of my visualizations. It aims to make it clear how to connect to Twitter Streaming API using <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>, <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> and <a href="http://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> and retrieve tweets to analyze them later.</p>

<p>If you have any further questions after reading this paper, feel free to contact me via <a href="https://twitter.com/zimmicz">Twitter</a> or <a href="mailto:zimmicz@gmail.com">e-mail</a>. I must say right here <strong>that the code will be shared as well as the map</strong>, but there are still some bugs/features I would like to remove/add.</p>

<p><small>On a side note: I have been studying cartography and GIS for the last five years at Masaryk University in Brno, Czech Republic. I am mostly interested in ways computers can make data handling easier. I&nbsp;like to code in Python.</small></p>

<h3>Using Twitter Streaming API</h3>

<p>As you probably know, Twitter offers three different APIs:</p>

<ul>
<li>REST API which is obviously RESTful. You can access almost every piece of information on Twitter with this one: tweets, users, places, retweets, followers&#8230;</li>
<li>Search API used for getting search results. You can customize these by sending parameters with your requests.</li>
<li><strong>Streaming API</strong> which I am going to tell you about. It is really different, as (again, obviously) it keeps streaming tweets from the time you connect to the server. This means, once the connection is made, it has to stay open as long as you want tweets coming to you. The important thing here is that you get real time tweets delivered to you via this <abbr title="Twitter only delivers a sample of tweets, not the whole traffic.">stream</abbr>, which implies you cannot use this API to get tweets already tweeted.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>To sum it up: You get a small sample of tweets in a real time as long as the connection to the server stays open.</strong></p>

<h3>What you need</h3>

<p>To use any of the Twitter APIs, you need to authenticate you (or your app) against Twitter via OAuth protocol. To be able to do so, you need a Twitter account, because only then you can <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/">create apps</a>, obtain access tokens and get authenticated for API use.</p>

<p>And then, obviously, you need something to connect to server with. I chose <strong>node.js</strong> because it seemed as a good tool to keep connection alive. I have also been interested in this technology for the couple of months but never really had a task to use it for.</p>

<p>The good thing about node.js is that it comes with lots of handy libraries. You get <strong>socket.io</strong> for streaming, <strong>ntwitter</strong> for using Twitter API and <strong>sqlite3</strong> for working with SQLite databases.</p>

<p>You need something to store the data in also. As mentioned, I picked SQLite for this task. It is lightweight, does not need server nor configuration to run, just what I was looking for. Seems we are set to go, right?</p>

<h3>Filtering the data</h3>

<p>I guess none of you is interested in obtaining random tweets from around the world, neither was I. I live in the Czech republic and that is the area I want to get tweets from. How?</p>

<p>It is fairly simple, you tell Twitter with the <code>locations</code> parameter of <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/post/statuses/filter"><code>statuses/filter</code></a> resource. This parameter specifies a set of bounding boxes to track.</p>

<p><strong>To sum it up: you connect to the server and tell it you just want to get tweets from the area you specified with the <code>locations</code> parameter. The server understands and keeps you posted.</strong></p>

<h4>Is it that simple?</h4>

<p>No. Twitter decides whether to post you the tweet or not according to what the value of coordinates field is. It goes like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>If the <code>coordinates</code> field is not empty, it gets tested against the bounding box. If it matches, it is sent to the stream.</li>
<li>If the <code>coordinates</code> field is empty, but the <code>place</code> field is not, it is the <code>place</code> field that gets checked. If if it by any extent intersects the bounding box, it is sent to the stream.</li>
<li>If both of the fields are empty, nothing is sent.</li>
</ol>

<p>I decided to throw away the tweets with the empty <code>coordinates</code> field, because the accuracy of the value specified in the place field can be generally considered very low and insufficient for my purposes. You still need to account for position inaccuracies of users&#8217; devices though, however that is not something that we can deal with. <em>Let us just assume that geotagged tweets are accurate.</em></p>

<div class="text-center"><img src="/posts/2014/analyzing-twitter-languages-with-streaming-api/cr.png" width="50%" height="50%" title="Geotagged tweets" class="img-rounded"><p><strong>Figure:</strong> Twitter seems not to be very accurate when matching tweets against bounding box.</p></div>

<p>Although, as you can see in the picture, they are not. Or they are, but Twitter is not good at telling so. Besides that, none of the countries in the world is shaped like a rectangle and we would need to clip the data anyway. That is where SQLite comes in, because I have been saving incoming tweets right into the database.</p>

<p>If you use any GUI manager (sqlitebrowser for Linux is just fine), you can easily export your data to the CSV file, load it into QGIS, clip it with Natural Earth countries shapefile and save them to the GeoJSON file. It is just a matter of few JavaScript lines of code to put GeoJSON on a Leaflet map.</p>

<h3>Displaying the data</h3>

<p>Once a GeoJSON file is ready, it can be used for making an appealing viz to get a sense of what may be called &#8220;nationalities spatial patterns&#8221;. The <code>lang</code> field (stored in the database, remember?) of every tweet is used to colour the marker accordingly. Its value represents a two-letter language code as specified in ISO 639-1 document.</p>

<p>However, as those codes are guessed by Twitter&#8217;s language algorithms, they are prone to error. There are actually three scenarios we might be facing:</p>

<ol>
<li>User tweets in the same language as used in the Twitter account.</li>
<li>User tweets in his/her mother language, but has set different Twitter account language.</li>
<li>User does not tweet in his/her mother language, but has it set as a Twitter account language.</li>
</ol>

<p>We basically have to deal with 2) and 3), because 1) means we can be pretty sure what nationality the user is. Sadly though, I have not found an easy way to tell which one of these two we came across, thus which language settings should be prioritized. I made an arbitrary decision to prioritize the language the tweet was written in, based on assumption that <strong>the most of the users tweet in their mother language</strong>. No matter what you do, the data is still going to be biased by automatically generated tweets, especially ones sent by Foursquare saying &#8220;I&#8217;m at @WhateverBarItIs (http://someurl.co)&#8221;. It works fine for the strange languages like Russian and Arabic though.</p>

<p>From Jan 2 to Jan 4 this year 5,090 tweets were collected. Leaflet is becoming a little sluggish without clustering turned on displaying all of them. Plans are to let the collection run until Jan 7 and then put all the tweets on the map. I guess that might be around 10,000 geotagged tweets by that time.</p>

<p>I am definitely willing to share the <abbr title="Do not expect much, it was my first time with node.js">code</abbr> and the final viz. Meanwhile, you can have a look at the screenshot on picture [*]. I have already implemented nationality switch (legend items are clickable) and I would like to add a day/night switch to see whether there are any differences between the peoples&#8217; behaviour. </p>

A legend is used to turn nationalities on and off. You are looking at Prague by the way.</p></div>

<p>Obviously the most tweets were sent from the most populated places, e.g. Prague, Brno, Ostrava. </p>
